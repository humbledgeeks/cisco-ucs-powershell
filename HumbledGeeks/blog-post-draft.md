# Automating a Cisco UCS FlexPod with NetApp ASA A30 on Broadcom VCF

<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER -->

## Why I'm Building This Now

If you've been following the Zero to VCAP series, you know I'm on a six-month run toward
the VCAP-VCF Administrator certification (the Broadcom Knighthood). I've been working
through the Broadcom Instructor-Led Training (ILT) videos, taking notes, building out study
guides, and generally trying to absorb as much of the VCF blueprint as I can.

But here's the thing: watching someone configure VCF in a video is not the same as doing it.
The VCAP exam isn't going to ask me what I *watched*. It's going to put me in a live
environment and ask me to *build* something. So it was time to stop watching and start
building.

This post documents the foundation of that lab: a Cisco UCS FlexPod with a NetApp ASA A30
running Broadcom VCF. This is real hardware, configured the way I'd configure it for a
customer deployment. The automation scripts are fully functional PowerShell, not sanitized
demos. And the design decisions (MTU sizing, vNIC layout, FC zoning) are deliberate choices
I made and will have to defend on the exam.

I work with this stack daily as a Solutions Architect, so some of this is familiar territory.
But standing up VCF as the hypervisor layer on top of a FlexPod, end to end, with everything
automated? That's the part I needed to actually do.

Real talk for a second. In the real world, you'd validate every piece of hardware
against the [Cisco Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT)](https://ucshcltool.cloudapps.cisco.com/public/)
before you ever rack a cable. Supported hardware, supported firmware, supported combinations. That's non-negotiable in a production environment. I know this because I spec these
solutions for customers.

But this is my home lab. I'm working with what I have available to me, and not all of it
is on the current IMT. If you're in the same boat, don't let that hold you back. Where
there's a will, there's a way. The fundamentals don't change just because your gear is a
generation or two behind. Use what you have, document what you're doing, and learn the
patterns. The exam tests your understanding of the architecture, not whether your blades
carry a current support contract.

If you're chasing the VCAP-VCF alongside me, or if you're just trying to automate a FlexPod
deployment and don't want to click through UCSM for two hours, this is for you.

## Where This Fits in the Zero to VCAP Journey

This post is the physical foundation of everything that follows in the series. You can't
deploy VCF without a working compute and storage layer underneath it, and you can't really
understand VCF architecture on paper. You have to build it.

The Broadcom ILT videos gave me the roadmap. This lab is where I actually drive. If you're
working through the same material and you have hardware sitting in a rack, I hope this post
saves you some of the trial and error I went through, especially around the boot policy
quirks, the VSAN placement, and the CDP/LLDP raw XML workaround.

Two more posts in this series will complete the build: cabling the ASA A30 and enabling FC
zoning, then the full VCF 4+4 deployment on top. Once that's done, I'll have a fully
functional lab that mirrors what you'd build in a real VCF engagement, and that's exactly
where I want to be when I sit down for the VCAP-VCF exam.

## This Is a FlexPod Validated Design

**NetApp FlexPod** is a jointly engineered, tested, and validated data-center architecture built on
[Cisco UCS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/servers-unified-computing/index.html),
[Cisco Nexus networking](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/data-center-switches/index.html),
and [NetApp ONTAP storage](https://www.netapp.com/data-storage/ontap/). When this hardware
was new, the exact bill-of-materials and software stack in this guide carried a Cisco
Validated Design (CVD) designation, meaning it was tested end-to-end by engineers at all
three vendors and published as a supported reference architecture.

The hardware here (UCS 6332-16UP FIs, UCS 5108 chassis, B200-M4/M5 blades, and
**NetApp ASA A30** all-flash array) is no longer current-generation, but
**we are still following all FlexPod best practices** for pool sizing, naming, VSAN layout,
policy structure, and boot configuration. If you're deploying a fresh FlexPod on current
hardware, the patterns here translate directly to modern UCS X-Series + NetApp AFF/ASA A-Series + Broadcom VCF builds.

## What We're Building

Eight B200 blades across a UCS 5108 chassis, dual 6300-series Fabric Interconnects, a
NetApp ASA A30 direct-attached via Fibre Channel, and [Broadcom VMware Cloud Foundation](https://www.broadcom.com/products/software/vmware)
as the hypervisor layer. The UCS side is scoped to a **HumbledGeeks sub-org**, isolated
from any other tenants on the shared domain.

**Key design constraint: MTU 1500 everywhere.** Block storage runs over Fibre Channel
vHBAs, and none of the Ethernet vNICs carry storage traffic. With no iSCSI or NFS on the
Ethernet path, jumbo frames aren't needed and MTU 1500 avoids any fragmentation risk if a
switch in the path isn't uniformly jumbo-enabled.

A follow-up post covers the VCF 4+4 management/workload domain deployment on top of this
foundation.

## The Hardware

| Component | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Fabric Interconnects | 2× Cisco UCS 6332-16UP |
| Chassis | 1× UCS 5108 |
| Blades | 1× B200-M5 (slot 1/1), 7× B200-M4 (slots 1/2–1/8) |
| Storage | NetApp ASA A30 (FC direct attach to FI storage ports 1–2 per FI) |
| Hypervisor | Broadcom VMware Cloud Foundation 5.x |

### Cabling

FI-A and FI-B connect to each other on ports L1/L2 for cluster heartbeat. Each FI connects
to both IOM modules in the chassis (ports 1/1 and 1/2 per chassis, twin-ax SFP-H10GB).
Northbound Ethernet uplinks go to upstream Nexus switches on ports 11–12; FC storage ports
1–2 on each FI connect directly to the ASA A30 target ports (one port per node, per fabric).

![Physical cabling — FIs, chassis, and blade connections](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/01-physical-cabling.png)

---

## Fabric Interconnect Initial Setup

Before software config, each FI is initialized via console (9600 8N1). FI-A is set up
first. When FI-B powers on and the L1/L2 cluster links are connected, it detects FI-A and
auto-joins the cluster.

```text

# FI-A serial wizard key answers

Install method:        Console
Setup Mode:            Setup
Create new cluster:    y
Switch fabric:         A
System name:           hg-ucs-fi-a
Mgmt0 IPv4 address:    10.x.x.x
Mgmt0 IPv4 netmask:    255.255.255.0
Default gateway:       10.x.x.x
Cluster IP:            10.x.x.x   ← virtual IP for UCSM

```powershell

After initial setup, use the UCSM port configuration wizard to configure the fixed-module
ports. On the UCS 6332-16UP, the first 16 ports of the fixed module are unified (Ethernet or
FC switchable). Set ports 1–2 as FC storage ports on both FI-A and FI-B — these connect
directly to the ASA A30. Ports 11–12 are used for Ethernet uplinks to the upstream switches.

![UCSM Configure Fixed Module Ports — set ports 1-2 as FC storage ports](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/02-fi-port-config.png)

> **Note:** Changing the FC port boundary causes the FI to reboot immediately.
> Do this before chassis discovery so blades don't lose connectivity mid-association.

After reboot, acknowledge each chassis in the Equipment tab to trigger discovery.

## Network Design

### Ethernet: 6 vNICs, MTU 1500

Each blade gets six virtual NICs (vNICs), presented to ESXi as `vmnic0` through `vmnic5`.
Think of each vmnic as a logical NIC backed by the physical FI uplinks: Fabric A backs the
even numbers, Fabric B backs the odd numbers, giving you active/active redundancy across
both FIs for every traffic type.

**What VLANs are allowed on each vNIC is controlled at the vNIC template level** (Step 4).
A vNIC template acts as an allowlist: only VLANs explicitly added to that template will be
visible on that interface. This is how you keep management traffic off the VM workload vNICs
and keep NSX TEP traffic on its own dedicated pair.

| vNIC Pair | Fabric | MTU | Purpose | VLANs Allowed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vmnic0 / vmnic1 | A / B | 1500 | ESXi management (vmk0) + vMotion (vmk1) | mgmt, vmotion |
| vmnic2 / vmnic3 | A / B | 1500 | VM workloads trunk (apps, core, Docker, GNS3) | all workload VLANs |
| vmnic4 / vmnic5 | A / B | 1500 | VCF overlay / NSX TEP (dedicated path) | TEP VLAN only |

Separating NSX TEP traffic onto vmnic4/5 keeps Geneve-encapsulated overlay frames off the
VM workload path and simplifies NSX transport zone configuration. All at MTU 1500.

### FC Storage: Direct Attach to ASA A30

| vHBA | Fabric | WWPN Pool | VSAN | ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vmhba0 | A | hg-wwpn-a | hg-vsan-a | 10 |
| vmhba1 | B | hg-wwpn-b | hg-vsan-b | 11 |

## Step 0: Prerequisites and Connect

**Full script →** [`00-prereqs-and-connect.ps1`](https://github.com/humbledgeeks/infra-automation/blob/main/Cisco/UCS/PowerShell/HumbledGeeks/00-prereqs-and-connect.ps1)

Every other script dot-sources this one. Run any section standalone without re-authenticating.

```powershell
$requiredModules = @('Cisco.UCS.Common', 'Cisco.UCS.Core', 'Cisco.UCSManager')
foreach ($mod in $requiredModules) {
    if (-not (Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name $mod)) {
        Install-Module $mod -Scope CurrentUser -Force -AllowClobber -AcceptLicense
    }
    Import-Module $mod -ErrorAction Stop
}

# Non-interactive: set $env:UCSM_PASSWORD before running, or fall back to Get-Credential

if ($env:UCSM_PASSWORD) {
    $cred = New-Object PSCredential('admin', (ConvertTo-SecureString $env:UCSM_PASSWORD -AsPlainText -Force))
} else {
    $cred = Get-Credential -UserName 'admin' -Message 'Enter UCSM credentials'
}
$global:UcsHandle = Connect-Ucs -Name '10.x.x.x' -Credential $cred -NotDefault
$global:HgOrg     = Get-UcsOrg -Ucs $global:UcsHandle | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq 'HumbledGeeks' }

```

## Step 1 — Identity Pools

**Full script →** [`01-pools.ps1`](https://github.com/humbledgeeks/infra-automation/blob/main/Cisco/UCS/PowerShell/HumbledGeeks/01-pools.ps1)

Always use **Sequential** assignment. Random (the default) makes troubleshooting painful, because sequential means blade-1 always gets the same MAC, UUID, and WWN after a rebuild.

**UUID Pool: Sequential, Derived prefix:**

![Create UUID Suffix Pool — Sequential assignment](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/03-uuid-pool-create.png)

**MAC Pool A: Fabric A addresses:**

![Create MAC Pool mac-pool-a — Sequential](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/04-mac-pool-a-create.png)

![MAC Pool A address block 00:25:B5:11:A0:01 – A0:80](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/05-mac-pool-a-blocks.png)

MAC Pool B mirrors this pattern with a distinct B-fabric range so you can always identify
which fabric a MAC belongs to at a glance.

**WWPN Pool: for FC vHBA assignment:**

![WWPN Pool A address block](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/06-wwpn-pool-blocks.png)

```powershell

---

## Step 2: VLANs and VSANs

**Full script →** [`02-vlans-vsans.ps1`](https://github.com/humbledgeeks/infra-automation/blob/main/Cisco/UCS/PowerShell/HumbledGeeks/02-vlans-vsans.ps1)

**This is where you define every VLAN your environment will use.** All VLANs must be
created here in the LAN cloud *before* you can assign them to vNIC templates in Step 4.
Think of this step as building your master VLAN list. If a VLAN isn't defined here,
it simply won't exist as an option anywhere else in UCSM.

For this FlexPod/VCF build, the VLANs break down like this:

| VLAN Name | ID | Assigned To | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dc3-mgmt | 16 | vmnic0/1 | ESXi host management, KVM access, UCSM |
| dc3-vmotion | 20 | vmnic0/1 | vMotion live migration traffic |
| dc3-workload-* | 30–99 | vmnic2/3 | VM guest traffic (apps, Docker, GNS3, etc.) |
| dc3-vcf-tep | 100 | vmnic4/5 | NSX Geneve overlay / VCF TEP encapsulation |

**Key rule:** Every VLAN is created as *Common/Global* (shared across both Fabric A and B)
with Sharing Type *None*. This makes the VLAN available for assignment on both fabrics
simultaneously, so you only have to create it once.

**How VLANs get to the blades (the vNIC allowlist):** Creating a VLAN here does not
automatically put it on the blades. In Step 4 you'll create vNIC templates, and each
template has an explicit list of VLANs it trunks. `vmnic0/1` only gets the management
and vMotion VLANs. `vmnic2/3` gets all the workload VLANs trunked together.
`vmnic4/5` gets only the TEP VLAN. This separation is intentional: it keeps broadcast
domains isolated and makes troubleshooting much cleaner.

**Create VLAN: Common/Global across both fabrics:**

![Create VLANs — Common/Global, Sharing Type None](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/07-vlan-create.png)

**Create VSAN: Fabric A scoped, VSAN 10, FCoE VLAN 1010:**

VSANs **must** be in the **FC Storage Cloud**, not FC Uplink. Getting this wrong means
FC ports will never come up correctly. Each VSAN is scoped to a single fabric
(A or B), giving you true path isolation all the way to the ASA A30 target ports.

![Create VSAN — FabricA, VSAN ID 10, FCoE VLAN 1010, FC Zoning Disabled](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/20-vsan-create.png)

> **FC Zoning is set to Disabled here, and that is intentional for now, not permanent.**
> FC Zoning IS required before ESXi can see storage on the ASA A30. But you cannot create
> zones for devices that haven't logged into the fabric yet. The ASA A30 target WWPNs won't
> appear in the fabric until the array is physically cabled to FI storage ports 29–32, and
> the ESXi initiator WWPNs won't be active until service profiles are associated to blades
> and the hosts are booted. Trying to configure zoning before either of those things happens
> is skipping steps.
>
> **With direct-attach (no MDS switch in the path), the FIs ARE the FC switch**, so UCSM's
> built-in FC zoning is the right tool. If you had an upstream MDS, you'd leave UCSM zoning
> disabled and configure zones on the MDS instead. Never enable zoning in both places.
>
> FC Zoning configuration is covered in a dedicated follow-up post once the ASA A30 is
> physically connected. See *What's Next* at the bottom of this post.

**Port Channel: Fabric A uplinks:**

![Create Port Channel FabricA — ID 21](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/08-port-channel-a.png)

![Port Channel A — ports 31 and 32 assigned](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/09-port-channel-a-ports.png)

```powershell

# --- Define all VLANs first (master VLAN list) ---

## Step 3: Policies

**Full script →** [`03-policies.ps1`](https://github.com/humbledgeeks/infra-automation/blob/main/Cisco/UCS/PowerShell/HumbledGeeks/03-policies.ps1)

### Network Control Policy: CDP and LLDP

The GUI shows CDP as a simple radio button. The **Cisco.UCS PowerShell module does not
expose CDP or LLDP** on `Add-UcsNetworkControlPolicy`; they require a raw XML API call.

![Create Network Control Policy — CDP Enabled, LLDP section visible below](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/10-network-control-policy.png)

```powershell
$ncp = Add-UcsNetworkControlPolicy -Org $org -Ucs $h `
    -Name 'hg-netcon' -MacRegisterMode 'only-native-vlan' `
    -ForgedTransmit 'deny' -ModifyPresent

# CDP + LLDP — not exposed by module; requires raw XML API

$xml = @"
<configConfMos cookie="$($h.Cookie)" inHierarchical="false">
  <inConfigs><pair key="$($ncp.Dn)">
    <nwctrlDefinition dn="$($ncp.Dn)"
      cdp="enabled" lldpTransmit="enabled" lldpReceive="enabled" status="modified"/>
  </pair></inConfigs>
</configConfMos>
"@
Invoke-UcsXml -Ucs $h -Xml $xml | Out-Null

```powershell

### QoS System Class

The original FlexPod guide sets the Best Effort system class MTU to **9216** when jumbo
frames are required. **In this design, we deliberately leave it at the default (1500).**
Storage is on FC; no Ethernet path requires jumbo frames, and a mismatched MTU anywhere in
a 9000-byte path causes silent packet drops.

```powershell

# MTU 1500 — intentional. Storage is FC; no jumbo frames needed.

Add-UcsQosClass -Ucs $h -Priority 'best-effort' -Mtu 'normal' -ModifyPresent

```

### Local Disk Policy: Any Configuration + FlexFlash

Use `any-configuration` mode; a restrictive mode throws disk config faults on blades whose
local storage doesn't match exactly. Enable FlexFlash so the SD card is visible to the
boot policy.

![Create Local Disk Configuration Policy — Any Configuration, FlexFlash enabled](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/11-local-disk-policy.png)

```powershell
Add-UcsLocalDiskConfigPolicy -Org $org -Ucs $h -Name 'hg-local-disk' `
    -Mode 'any-configuration' `
    -FlexFlashState 'enable' -FlexFlashRAIDReportingState 'enable' `
    -ModifyPresent

```powershell

### Maintenance Policy: Always User Ack

Without user-ack, binding an SP to a running blade can trigger an immediate disruptive
reboot. This is the single most important policy to get right before associating.

![Create Maintenance Policy — User Ack selected, 150s soft shutdown timer](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/12-maintenance-policy.png)

```powershell
Add-UcsMaintenancePolicy -Org $org -Ucs $h -Name 'hg-maint' `
    -UptimeDisr 'user-ack' -DataDisr 'user-ack' `
    -Descr 'User-ack required before disruptive changes' -ModifyPresent

```

### Boot Policy: UEFI, Three-Tier: DVD → SSD → FlexFlash SD

UEFI mode is preferred over Legacy for ESXi on mixed blade generations, because it gives
deterministic device order between the M5's internal SSD and the M4's FlexFlash SD card.

![Create Boot Policy — UEFI mode, CD/DVD order 1, Local Disk order 2](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/13-boot-policy.png)

> **UCSM constraint:** Only one `lsbootStorage` container is allowed per boot policy. Both
> SSD (`lsbootEmbeddedLocalDiskImage`) and FlexFlash (`lsbootUsbFlashStorageImage`) must
> live inside the same `storage → local-storage` hierarchy. Boot order numbers are globally
> unique across all nesting levels. See *Hard-Won Lessons* for the full story.

```powershell
$bp = Add-UcsBootPolicy -Org $org -Ucs $h -Name 'hg-flexflash' -BootMode 'uefi' -ModifyPresent

Set-UcsBiosVfProcessorCState              -BiosPolicy $bios -VpProcessorCState 'disabled'                -ModifyPresent

```powershell

### vNIC/vHBA Placement Policy

Controls how vNICs and vHBAs are distributed across physical adapters. Round Robin with
vCon 1 set to Assigned Only ensures vNIC order is consistent across all blades.

![Create Placement Policy — Round Robin, Virtual Slot 1 Assigned Only](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/27-placement-policy.png)

## Step 4: vNIC Templates

**Full script →** [`04-vnic-templates.ps1`](https://github.com/humbledgeeks/infra-automation/blob/main/Cisco/UCS/PowerShell/HumbledGeeks/04-vnic-templates.ps1)

All six templates at MTU 1500. Storage is on FC, so there's no Ethernet storage path and no jumbo frames needed.

```powershell

# VM workloads trunk — MTU 1500 (block storage runs over FC vHBAs, not Ethernet)

Add-UcsVnicTemplate -Org $org -Ucs $h `
    -Name 'hg-vmnic2' -SwitchId 'A' -TemplType 'updating-template' `
    -IdentPoolName 'hg-mac-a' -Mtu 1500 `
    -NwCtrlPolicyName 'hg-netcon' -QosPolicyName 'hg-qos-be' -ModifyPresent

# VCF overlay / NSX TEP — dedicated pair at MTU 1500

Add-UcsVnicTemplate -Org $org -Ucs $h `
    -Name 'hg-vmnic4' -SwitchId 'A' -TemplType 'updating-template' `
    -IdentPoolName 'hg-mac-a' -Mtu 1500 `
    -NwCtrlPolicyName 'hg-netcon' -QosPolicyName 'hg-qos-be' -ModifyPresent

```powershell

## Step 5: vHBA Templates

**Full script →** [`05-vhba-templates.ps1`](https://github.com/humbledgeeks/infra-automation/blob/main/Cisco/UCS/PowerShell/HumbledGeeks/05-vhba-templates.ps1)

Two FC vHBAs (one path per fabric) give true dual-path to the NetApp ASA A30.

![Create vHBA Template — vmhba1 Fabric B, VSAN FabricB, Updating Template, WWPN pool-b](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/15-vhba-template.png)

```powershell
$vhbaA = Add-UcsVhbaTemplate -Org $org -Ucs $h `
    -Name 'hg-vmhba0' -SwitchId 'A' -TemplType 'updating-template' `
    -IdentPoolName 'hg-wwpn-a' -MaxDataFieldSize 2048 `
    -QosPolicyName 'hg-qos-be' -ModifyPresent

# Bind VSAN to the template

Add-UcsVhbaInterface -VhbaTemplate $vhbaA -Ucs $h -Name 'hg-vsan-a' -ModifyPresent

```

## Step 6: Service Profile Template

**Full script →** [`06-service-profile-template.ps1`](https://github.com/humbledgeeks/infra-automation/blob/main/Cisco/UCS/PowerShell/HumbledGeeks/06-service-profile-template.ps1)

The SP template ties everything together. Template type **must** be `updating-template`;
it cannot be changed in-place after creation (delete and recreate if you get it wrong).

**Step 1: Identity:** Name, Updating Template, UUID pool:

![Create Service Profile Template — name, Updating Template type, UUID pool assignment](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/21-sp-template-identity.png)

**Step 3: Networking:** Six vNICs bound to templates, VMware adapter policy:

![Create vNIC in SP — bound to vNIC template with VMware adapter policy](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/16-vnic-in-sp.png)

![SP Template Networking — all six vNICs showing as fabric-derived](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/17-sp-template-networking.png)

**Step 4: SAN Connectivity:** vHBAs bound to templates with VMware FC adapter policy:

![Create vHBA in SP — bound to vHBA template, VMware FC adapter policy](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/22-sp-vhba-binding.png)

**Step 8: Server Boot Order:** Boot policy assigned:

![SP Template — Server Boot Order step, boot-Policy selected showing CD/DVD(1) + Local Disk(2)](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/23-sp-boot-order.png)

**Step 11: Operational Policies:** BIOS, Management IP (KVM), Power, and Scrub:

![SP Template Operational Policies — BIOS policy assigned](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/24-sp-bios-policy.png)

![SP Template — Management IP from ext-mgmt pool](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/25-sp-mgmt-ip.png)

```powershell
$spt = Add-UcsServiceProfile -Org $org -Ucs $h `
    -Name              'hg-esx-template' `
    -Type              'updating-template' `
    -UuidPoolName      'hg-uuid-pool' `

    -ModifyPresent

# Bind vNICs in template order (vmnic0-5, orders 1-6)

$order = 1
foreach ($tpl in @('hg-vmnic0','hg-vmnic1','hg-vmnic2','hg-vmnic3','hg-vmnic4','hg-vmnic5')) {
    Add-UcsVnic -ServiceProfile $spt -Ucs $h `
        -Name "vmnic$($order-1)" -NwTemplName $tpl `
        -AdaptorProfileName 'VMWare' -Order $order -ModifyPresent | Out-Null
    $order++
}

> [`06-service-profile-template.ps1`](https://github.com/humbledgeeks/infra-automation/blob/main/Cisco/UCS/PowerShell/HumbledGeeks/06-service-profile-template.ps1)

---

## Step 7: Create Service Profiles

Service profiles are the heart of UCS identity management. A service profile is the
**logical definition of a server**: it carries the UUID, MAC addresses, WWPNs, boot
policy, vNIC/vHBA bindings, BIOS policy, and maintenance policy. When a profile is
associated to a physical blade, the blade takes on that identity. Swap a blade, associate
the profile to the new hardware, and it comes up with the same identity, no OS
reconfiguration needed.

Because `06-service-profile-template.ps1` already created `hg-esx-template` as an
**Updating Service Profile Template**, every profile derived from it is a bound instance.
Any future change to the template (new VLAN, updated BIOS tuning, changed boot policy)
automatically propagates to all 8 profiles. This is the right model for a homogenous ESXi
cluster.

### VCF 4+4 Role Split

Eight blades, two roles:

| Service Profile | Blade Slot | VCF Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hg-esx-01` | chassis-1 / blade-1 | Management Domain |
| `hg-esx-02` | chassis-1 / blade-2 | Management Domain |
| `hg-esx-03` | chassis-1 / blade-3 | Management Domain |
| `hg-esx-04` | chassis-1 / blade-4 | Management Domain |
| `hg-esx-05` | chassis-1 / blade-5 | VI Workload Domain |
| `hg-esx-06` | chassis-1 / blade-6 | VI Workload Domain |
| `hg-esx-07` | chassis-1 / blade-7 | VI Workload Domain |
| `hg-esx-08` | chassis-1 / blade-8 | VI Workload Domain |

The management domain (hg-esx-01–04) runs vCenter, NSX Manager, and SDDC Manager.
The VI workload domain (hg-esx-05–08) is your first compute cluster for actual workloads.

### Step 7a: Create the Profiles (script)

**Full script →** [`07-deploy-service-profiles.ps1`](https://github.com/humbledgeeks/infra-automation/blob/main/Cisco/UCS/PowerShell/HumbledGeeks/07-deploy-service-profiles.ps1)

This script creates all 8 profiles in an **unassociated** state, with no blade binding yet.
Keeping creation and association separate lets you verify the profiles look correct in the
UCSM GUI before anything is written to hardware.

```powershell
$spDefs = @(
    @{ Name = 'hg-esx-01'; Role = 'Management Domain' },
    @{ Name = 'hg-esx-02'; Role = 'Management Domain' },
    @{ Name = 'hg-esx-03'; Role = 'Management Domain' },
    @{ Name = 'hg-esx-04'; Role = 'Management Domain' },
    @{ Name = 'hg-esx-05'; Role = 'VI Workload Domain' },
    @{ Name = 'hg-esx-06'; Role = 'VI Workload Domain' },
    @{ Name = 'hg-esx-07'; Role = 'VI Workload Domain' },
    @{ Name = 'hg-esx-08'; Role = 'VI Workload Domain' }
)

foreach ($def in $spDefs) {
    Add-UcsServiceProfile -Org $org -Ucs $h `
        -Name         $def.Name `
        -SrcTemplName 'hg-esx-template' `
        -Type         'instance' `
        -ModifyPresent
}

```

After running, in UCSM you should see all 8 profiles under
**Service Profiles → HumbledGeeks** with `AssocState = unassociated`.

> **Verify via PowerShell:**
>
> ```powershell
> Get-UcsServiceProfile -Ucs $h | Where-Object { $_.Dn -like '*HumbledGeeks*' } |
>     Select-Object Name, Type, SrcTemplName, AssocState | Format-Table -AutoSize
>
> ```

### Step 7b — Associate Profiles to Blades (GUI or script)

**Association is intentionally deferred.** Before you associate profiles to blades, you
need two things in place that aren't ready yet at this stage of the build:

1. **The ASA A30 must be physically cabled** to FI storage ports 1–2 (UCS 6332-16UP). Association
   activates the vHBA WWPNs and they will log into the FC fabric, but if the storage array
   isn't connected, those FC logins go nowhere.

2. **FC Zoning must be configured** in UCSM (covered in the follow-up post). Without zones,
   ESXi will see the FC fabric but won't be able to reach any LUNs on the ASA A30.

When you're ready to associate, either via the UCSM GUI (drag service profile onto a blade)
or via the script:

**Script →** [`07b-associate-service-profiles.ps1`](https://github.com/humbledgeeks/infra-automation/blob/main/Cisco/UCS/PowerShell/HumbledGeeks/07b-associate-service-profiles.ps1)

```powershell

# Bind each SP to its physical blade slot

$blade = Get-UcsBlade -Ucs $h -ChassisId 1 -ServerId 1
Add-UcsLsBinding -ServiceProfile $sp -Ucs $h -PnDn $blade.Dn

```powershell

Because `hg-maint` is set to **user-ack**, UCSM will not reboot blades immediately.
After association, acknowledge the pending change in the GUI under each service profile →
**Pending Changes → Acknowledge**, or via PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-UcsLsmaintAck -Ucs $h | Where-Object { $_.AdminState -eq 'trigger-immediate' } |
    Set-UcsLsmaintAck -AdminState 'trigger-immediate' -Force

```

The blade will power-cycle and come up with the identity defined in the service profile:
UUID from `hg-uuid-pool`, MACs from `hg-mac-a/b`, WWPNs from `hg-wwpn-a/b`, and the
KVM management IP from `hg-ext-mgmt`.

---

## Step 8 — Admin Configuration (NTP and DNS)

NTP and DNS are bundled into `03-policies.ps1` — there is no separate Step 8 script.
Running the policies script handles this automatically; nothing extra to run here.

**Reference →** [`03-policies.ps1`](https://github.com/humbledgeeks/infra-automation/blob/main/Cisco/UCS/PowerShell/HumbledGeeks/03-policies.ps1)

Don't skip NTP. UCSM uses timestamps for fault correlation, syslog, and certificate
validation — a drifting clock causes subtle issues that are hard to trace back to time skew.

```powershell

# NTP — set timezone and add servers

$tz = Get-UcsTimezone -Ucs $h
Set-UcsTimezone -Timezone $tz -AdminState 'enabled' -Timezone 'America/Los_Angeles' -Force
Add-UcsNtpServer -Ucs $h -Name '10.x.x.x' -ModifyPresent  # primary NTP
Add-UcsNtpServer -Ucs $h -Name '10.x.x.x' -ModifyPresent  # secondary NTP

# DNS

Add-UcsDnsServer -Ucs $h -Name '10.x.x.x' -ModifyPresent  # primary DNS
Add-UcsDnsServer -Ucs $h -Name '10.x.x.x' -ModifyPresent  # secondary DNS

```text

## Step 9 — Pre-Build FC Zoning (Before the ASA A30 Arrives)

**Full script →** [`09-fc-zoning.ps1`](https://github.com/humbledgeeks/infra-automation/blob/main/Cisco/UCS/PowerShell/HumbledGeeks/09-fc-zoning.ps1)

This is the part that trips people up: FC zoning feels like something you do *after* the
storage is connected, but you can actually pre-build every zone before the ASA A30 is
physically cabled. Here's why that works.

### Why You Can Zone Before Cabling

UCSM's FC zoning references endpoints by **WWPN**, and both sets of WWPNs are available
before any hardware is physically connected:

**ASA A30 target WWPNs** are fixed hardware addresses that don't change. Pull them from
ONTAP's management interface (`storage port show`) or from NetApp System Manager under
Storage → FC Ports before you ever touch a cable.

**ESXi initiator WWPNs** come from the WWPN pools you defined in `01-pools.ps1`. Here's
the key insight: **UCSM assigns WWPNs from the pool at service profile creation time, not
at blade association.** The moment `07-deploy-service-profiles.ps1` runs and instantiates
the 8 profiles, each vHBA gets a permanent WWPN from `hg-wwpn-a` and `hg-wwpn-b`. Those
addresses don't change when you associate to a blade. The blade takes on the identity
defined in the profile. This means you can read the initiator WWPNs out of UCSM today and
write zones around them, even though no blade has been touched.

### Single-Initiator Zoning (FlexPod Best Practice)

The zone design is one zone per vHBA per fabric: 8 blades × 2 fabrics = **16 zones**.
Each zone has exactly one initiator WWPN and all ASA A30 target WWPNs for that fabric:

| Zone | Fabric | Initiator | Targets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hg-esx-01-fab-a` | A | `20:00:00:25:B5:11:1A:01` | 4× ASA A30 Fabric A ports |
| `hg-esx-01-fab-b` | B | `20:00:00:25:B5:11:1B:01` | 4× ASA A30 Fabric B ports |
| `hg-esx-02-fab-a` | A | `20:00:00:25:B5:11:1A:02` | 4× ASA A30 Fabric A ports |
| … | … | … | … |
| `hg-esx-08-fab-b` | B | `20:00:00:25:B5:11:1B:08` | 4× ASA A30 Fabric B ports |

Single-initiator zoning prevents one faulty initiator from disrupting other hosts' paths,
and makes troubleshooting straightforward. If an ESXi host loses storage, you look at
exactly two zones.

### Cabling Assumption

The script assumes standard FlexPod HA-pair cabling:

| ASA A30 Port | FI Port | Fabric |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ASA30-node1 port n1_fc_a_1a | FI-A port 1 | A |
| ASA30-node1 port n1_fc_b_1d | FI-B port 1 | B |
| ASA30-node2 port n2_fc_a_1a | FI-A port 2 | A |
| ASA30-node2 port n2_fc_b_1d | FI-B port 2 | B |

If your cabling differs, edit `$fabricATargets` and `$fabricBTargets` at the top of the
script before running.

### Running the Script

The zone profile is created with `AdminState = disabled` — safe to run right now:

```powershell

# Pre-build all 16 zones (profile stays disabled — nothing activates)

.\09-fc-zoning.ps1

# Later, once ASA A30 is cabled and blade profiles are associated:

.\09-fc-zoning.ps1 -Enable

```

The `-Enable` flag flips the zone profile to `AdminState = enabled`, which pushes the zone
set to both FIs and makes them active on the FC fabric. At that point your ESXi hosts will
see the ASA A30 LUNs.

```powershell

# Core of what the script does — shown here for context:

$profile = Add-UcsFabricFcZoneProfile -Ucs $h `
    -Name 'hg-fc-zones' -AdminState 'disabled' -ModifyPresent

foreach ($init in $initiators) {
    $zone = Add-UcsFabricFcUserZone -Ucs $h `
        -FabricFcZoneProfile $profile `
        -Name "hg-$($init.Sp -replace '^hg-','')-fab-a" `
        -Path 'A' -ModifyPresent

    # One initiator endpoint
    Add-UcsFabricFcEndpoint -Ucs $h -FabricFcUserZone $zone `
        -Name "$($init.Sp)-vmhba0" -Wwpn $init.FabA -ModifyPresent | Out-Null

    # Four target endpoints (all ASA A30 Fabric A ports)
    foreach ($tgt in $fabricATargets) {
        Add-UcsFabricFcEndpoint -Ucs $h -FabricFcUserZone $zone `
            -Name $tgt.Name -Wwpn $tgt.Wwpn -ModifyPresent | Out-Null
    }
}

```powershell

> **UCSM name limit:** Zone profile and zone names must be ≤ 16 characters.
> `hg-fc-zones` (11 chars) and `hg-esx-01-fab-a` (15 chars) both fit cleanly.

## Hard-Won UCSM Lessons

**Boot policy RN gets a mandatory prefix.** Name it `hg-flexflash` and UCSM stores it as
`boot-policy-hg-flexflash`. Hardcoding the wrong DN in XML API calls produces silent
failures. Always probe with `configResolveClass lsbootPolicy` first.

**Only one `lsbootStorage` container per boot policy.** UCSM silently discards any second
storage container you try to create. All local boot devices (SSD and SD card) must live
inside the same `storage → local-storage` hierarchy, ordered by their `order` attribute.
Boot order numbers are globally unique across all nesting levels.

**CDP and LLDP are not exposed by the Cisco.UCS PowerShell module.** The correct attributes
on `nwctrlDefinition` are `cdp`, `lldpTransmit`, and `lldpReceive`. Use `Invoke-UcsXml`
with a raw `configConfMos` payload.

**UCSM silently drops unknown XML attributes and returns HTTP 200.** Always verify with a
`configResolveDn` query after any XML API write. This bit us on the maintenance policy.
`rebootPolicy` is not valid; the correct attributes are `uptimeDisr` and `dataDisr`.

**VSANs belong in the FC Storage Cloud, not FC Uplink.** FC port VSAN membership is also
assigned *from* the VSAN scope, not from the port scope.

**WWN pool purpose is a creation-time keyword.** You cannot set `node-wwn-assignment` after
a pool is created. Delete and recreate if you get it wrong.

**SP template type cannot be changed in-place.** `updating-template` vs `instance` is set
at creation only.

**The QoS system class MTU matters.** The original FlexPod guide sets Best Effort to 9216
for NFS/iSCSI paths. In this design it stays at the default because storage is on FC and no
Ethernet path needs jumbo frames. Always match this setting to your actual traffic profile.

## Before You Associate Blades

**Add a firmware management policy before associating blades.**
On a mixed M4/M5 fleet, ensure the host firmware package covers both blade generations.

![Create Host Firmware Package — Advanced mode, BIOS tab](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/18-firmware-package.png)

```powershell
Add-UcsFirmwareComputeHostPack -Org $org -Ucs $h `
    -Name 'hg-fw' -BladeBundleVersion '4.2(3e)' -ModifyPresent

```powershell

**Consider a scrub policy for lab teardowns.**
Disk + BIOS + FlexFlash scrub on disassociation avoids stale ESXi installs on SD cards
between rebuilds.

![Create Scrub Policy — Disk, BIOS Settings, and FlexFlash Scrub all Yes](https://humbledgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/19-scrub-policy.png)

```powershell
Add-UcsScrubPolicy -Org $org -Ucs $h -Name 'hg-scrub' `
    -DiskScrub 'yes' -BiosSettingsScrub 'yes' -FlexFlashScrub 'yes' -ModifyPresent

```

**Separate pool ranges per fabric.** Non-overlapping MAC and WWPN ranges let you immediately
identify which fabric a path belongs to during storage troubleshooting.

**Sequential assignment everywhere.** After a full teardown/rebuild, blade-1 always gets
the same identity from every pool, predictable for IPAM, IPMI, and storage zoning.

**Check the FlexPod CVDs for your specific versions.**
[NetApp FlexPod for VMware VCF](https://www.netapp.com/data-storage/flexpod/) and
[Cisco's FlexPod Design Zone](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/design-zone/networking-design-guides/flexpod.html)
publish validated designs updated for every major VCF and ONTAP release. Always cross-check
your firmware matrix against the CVD for your target versions.

## What's Next

This post covers the UCS foundation. Two follow-up posts will complete the build:

### Post 2: Cable the ASA A30 and Configure FC Zoning

Before ESXi can see any storage, the [NetApp ASA A30](https://www.netapp.com/asa/) needs to
be physically connected and zones need to be created. That post will cover:

1. **Cable ASA A30 to FI storage ports**: FI-A ports 29–30, FI-B ports 29–30 for dual-fabric redundancy

2. **Associate service profiles**: Run `07b-associate-service-profiles.ps1` (or use the UCSM GUI); blade vHBAs log into the fabric and ESXi initiator WWPNs become active

3. **FC Zoning in UCSM**: With direct-attach (no MDS), the FIs are the FC switch; create initiator-to-target zones per fabric in UCSM's FC Zoning policy

4. **ONTAP igroup + LUN mapping**: Create an igroup with all ESXi initiator WWPNs, map datastores LUNs to it

### Post 3: Deploy Broadcom VCF 5.x (4+4)

With storage visible, the VCF deployment can proceed:

1. **ESXi staging**: Mount ISO to virtual KVM DVD or configure PXE on dc3-mgmt (VLAN 16)

2. **Management domain**: Four blades running vCenter, NSX Manager, and SDDC Manager

3. **VI workload domain**: Four blades for the first workload domain; KVM IPs from `hg-ext-mgmt` feed the Cloud Builder deployment JSON

4. **NSX networking**: TEP overlay on dc3-vcf-tep (VLAN 100), N-VDS configuration per VCF design
